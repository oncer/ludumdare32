# Pebble's Bakery

Play as Pebble the Bear and help him run his small bakery.
Everyone loves your bread rolls, they are sold out very quickly!
A fascinating game teaches you how to make the rolls, and always watch the oven so they don't burn. Nobody likes burnt rolls!
Open the shop, and make sure to keep your customers satisfied. If there only was a way to make your small stock of delicious rolls last longer. Good to know that Pebble never gives up. Did we mention he is a bear?
